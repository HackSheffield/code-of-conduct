# HackSheffield Code of Conduct

Last updated: 17 December 2017

## Aim

HackSheffield (hereinafter the “Society”, “We”, “Us”, “Our”) aims to foster an inclusive, accessible and friendly environment for everyone in all Society spaces, regardless of their gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), technology choices or ability.

We’re all here to build, create and have fun, and this Code of Conduct aims to facilitate this. It will be interpreted with these goals in mind.

## Code

In order to achieve this aim, We will not tolerate any form of abuse, harassment or discrimination at Society events and spaces (including online spaces).

Behaviour We consider to be unacceptable includes:

- Offensive or exclusionary comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), technology choices or ability
- Displaying or disseminating sexual imagery in public spaces
- Inappropriate physical contact
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Sustained disruption of events
- Deliberate intimidation
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour

Absolutely everyone involved with our activities are subject to this Code of Conduct. These terms apply equally to sponsors and speakers. In particular, sponsors and speakers should not use any sexualised imagery in their promotional material, and staff (including volunteers) should not wear sexualised clothing or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

These terms also apply to spaces where a reasonable person would consider you to be represented the Society or its members.

## Complying with relevant authorities

Members, attendees, and sponsors must comply with UK law.

Society events will be subject to University of Sheffield Students’ Union policy.

Social events held by the Society will be subject to the University of Sheffield Students’ Union’s policy on alcohol.

All Society events affiliated with Major League Hacking will additionally be subject to relevant MLH regulations, including the [MLH Code of Conduct](https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf).

Where this document conflicts with any of the above, We will defer to the relevant authority.

## Enforcement

If you are a victim of, or witness, unacceptable behaviour, or have any other concerns, you should contact event staff or the Society committee as soon as possible. Reports, concerns, comments and suggestions can be submitted in complete confidence to the Society’s Inclusion Officer (at inclusion@hacksheffield.co).

You do not need to be a member of the Society to make a report.

You may also make a report to the University of Sheffield’s Students’ Union where applicable if you do not feel comfortable contacting the Society committee, or if you feel that the committee has not adequately addressed your concerns.

Reports will be investigated in the strictest of confidence with respect to all relevant parties (including the reporter, the alleged victim and the accused).

Anyone asked to stop any unacceptable behaviour must do so immediately.

Parties who repeatedly or egregiously breach the Code of Conduct will, at the discretion of organisers and the Society committee, be ejected from the event or space where the breach or breaches took place (without refund or compensation) and, where it is deemed necessary, banned from future events. Where applicable and in accordance with the University of Sheffield Students’ Union policy, offenders may have their Society membership revoked.

When a complaint is made about a member of the Society committee, it may be referred to the University of Sheffield’s Students’ Union.

The Society committee will be happy to assist complainants in contacting venue security and/or law enforcement.

## Final Notes

HackSheffield reserves the right to revise, make exceptions to, or otherwise amend these policies in whole or in part. If you have any questions regarding these policies, please contact HackSheffield by e-mail at team@hacksheffield.co.
